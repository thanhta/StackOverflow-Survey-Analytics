## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This is the repo of the Writing a Data Science Blog Post project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. Which are the top 100 countries have the most participants in the survey?
2. What is the median salary of participants in Stackoverflow survey from the top 19 countries (where each country has more than 100 participants in the survey)?
3. What are the median salaries of three gender groups (Male, Female and others) among these 19 countries?
4. What is the median salary of participants group by years of coding at the current job?
5. What are the median salaries of three gender groups (Male, Female and others) for different years of coding on the current job?
6. What are the most favorite programming languages that the developers in this survey want to work on?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook in the repository that goes through analysis related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the blog available [here](https://medium.com/@thanhta2010/do-you-know-it-professionals-for-both-males-and-females-in-us-got-paid-much-better-comparing-with-e0a4e16187a8).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. The survey data is also included in this repository as a zip file. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
